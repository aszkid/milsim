# Coding conventions

- *PascalCase* namespace and class names.
- *camelCase* method and function names.
- *snake_case* variable names.

- `TAB` instead of spaces (set your editor to 4-space-wide tabs).
- Most things from [Linus' coding style](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.10/process/coding-style.html) with regards to braces, spaces, etc.
