# Roadmap

## Immediate Priorities
- [x] Skeleton `Alexandria` implementation.
- [ ] Simple rendering pipeline implementation (_not_ deferred, calm down boy).
- [ ] `Scene::Node` component-based, i.e. every scene node has a list of `Scene::Component`s?
- [x] Base `Object` class that has a handle to systems.
	+ Rethink whether `Object` needs a handle to `Alexandria`...

## On the horizon
- `Sys.Script` + hooks
